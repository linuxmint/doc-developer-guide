Daily Builds
============

If you want to keep up to date with the latest git changes, you don't need to rebuild everything all the time, you can use the Daily Builds PPA instead.

.. important::
    The Daily Builds PPA contains daily builds of the very latest changes pushed by the developers on github. By using this PPA you'll upgrade from stable to unstable versions which might introduce regressions or not work at all.

Adding the PPA
--------------

To add the PPA to your computer, open a terminal and type:

.. code-block:: console

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxmint-daily-build-team/daily-builds
	sudo apt-get update

Upgrading software to unstable versions
---------------------------------------

Use the `Update Manager` to upgrade your software to unstable versions.

Reporting bugs
--------------

If you notice a regression, you can report it on the `Alpha Testing Github project <https://github.com/linuxmint/alpha-testing>`_.

Make sure to read the disclaimers and information provided by this project before reporting issues. This project is only about regressions which appeared after the latest stable version of projects, not issues which already existed before then.

Downgrading back to stable
--------------------------

To go back to stable versions, either restore a Timeshift snapshot, or remove the PPA, update the APT cache and use the `Maintenance -> Downgrade foreign packages` section of the `Software Sources` tool.
