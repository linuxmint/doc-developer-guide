    Binary view of the various processes within a Cinnamon session

The figure above shows the various processes at play within a Cinnamon session.

After you log in, the following processes are automatically started:

- cinnamon-session (the session manager which starts all the other processes)
- cinnamon (which is the visual part of the cinnamon desktop)
- nemo-desktop (which handles the desktop icons and desktop context menu)
- cinnamon-screensaver (the screensaver)
- various csd-* processes (which are settings daemon plugins and run in the background)

The nemo process starts when you browse files and directories. It remains open as long as at least one file manager window is open.

The cinnamon-settings process starts when you launch the `System Settings` and remains open as long as at least one configuration module is open.


Libraries
---------

cinnamon-menus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `cinnamon-menus` library provides utility functions to read and monitor the set of desktop applications installed on the computer. Thanks to `cinnamon-menus`, Cinnamon can quickly list installed applications within the application menu, fetch application icons for the menu, the alt-tab selector and the window-list and keep this data in sync whenever applications are installed or removed from the computer.

The cinnamon-menus library is developed in C and the source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-menus>`_.

cinnamon-desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`cinnamon-desktop` is a set of utility libraries and settings used by other Cinnamon components.

Whenever multiple desktop components need to access the same resource (whether this is a setting or a utility function), we place this resource in cinnamon-desktop.

Here's an overview of some of the resources currently in `cinnamon-desktop`:


================  =========================================================================
cinnamon.desktop  dconf settings schemas used by several Cinnamon components
libcvc            A PulseAudio utility library used to control sound volume and devices
gnomerr           An Xrandr utility library to detect, load and save monitor configurations
gnome-xkb         A keyboard layout utility library
gnome-bg          A wallpaper utility library
gnome-installer   A cross-distribution library used to install software applications
================  =========================================================================

The cinnamon-desktop library is developed in C and the source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-desktop>`_.

muffin
~~~~~~

Muffin, or `libmuffin` to be more precise is a window management library.

Within the Cinnamon desktop environment, the Window Manager isn't running in a separate process. The main `cinnamon` process implements the `libmuffin` library and therefore runs both the visible components (panel, applets..etc) and the window manager.

.. note::
    The `muffin` package also provides a `muffin` binary. This binary is a small program which implements `libmuffin` and provides a minimal window manager, sometimes used by the developers as a troubleshooting tool. Note that whether or not `muffin` is installed by default in Linux Mint, it doesn't run by default in a Cinnamon session. The `cinnamon` process, which also implements `libmuffin`, is the default window manager.

The clutter and cogl libraries are also part of the muffin package now. Clutter is a library for creating and displaying both 2d and 3d graphical elements. It is used both by muffin itself (eg. for compositing and setting up the stage), and also by St in cinnamon (all St widgets are clutter actors). Cogl is a library that clutter uses for 3d rendering.

Muffin is developed in C and the source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/muffin>`_.

cjs
~~~

CJS is Cinnamon's Javascript interpreter. It uses MozJS (Mozilla's `SpiderMonkey <https://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/>`_) and makes it possible to work with GObject and interact with GIR, GNOME and Cinnamon libraries using that language.

CJS is run by and within the main `cinnamon` process and the parts of the desktop written in Javascript are contained in the main Cinnamon component.

CJS is developed in C++ and Javascript and the source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/cjs>`_.

Core components
---------------

cinnamon-session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cinnamon session manager is responsible for launching all the components needed by the session after you log in, and closing the session properly when you want to log out.

Among other things, the session manager launches the core components required by the session (such as the desktop itself and its components), as well as applications which are configured to start automatically.

Cinnamon-session also provides a DBus interface called the Presence interface, which makes it easy for applications such as media players to set the sessions as busy and inhibit power management (suspend, hibernate, etc...) and the screensaver during video playback.

Last but not least, the session management lets applications register so they can be closed cleanly. The text editor for instance is registered to the session when launched and interacts with it on logout. If a document isn't saved, the session is aware of it and lets you save your work before proceeding to log out.

cinnamon-settings-daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`cinnamon-settings-daemon` is a collection of processes which run in the background during your Cinnamon session.

Here's a description of some of these processes.

=======================  =========================================================================
csd-automount            Automatically mounts hardware devices when they are plugged in
csd-clipboard            Manages the additional copy-paste buffer available via Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V
csd-housekeeping         Handles the thumbnail cache and keeps an eye on the space available on the disk
csd-keyboard             Handles keyboard layouts and configuration
csd-media-keys           Handles media keys
csd-mouse                Handles mice and touch devices
csd-orientation          Handles accelerometers and screen orientation
csd-power                Handles battery and power management
csd-print-notifications  Handles printer notifications
csd-wacom                Handles wacom devices
csd-xrandr               Handles screen resolution and monitors configuration
csd-xsettings            Handles X11 and GTK configuration
=======================  =========================================================================

Cinnamon-settings-daemon is developed in C and the source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-settings-daemon>`_.

Visible desktop layer
---------------------

cinnamon-screensaver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cinnamon screensaver is responsible for locking the screen and to a lesser extent for handling some power management functions (although most of these are handled by csd-power within the Cinnamon Settings Daemon).

Cinnamon-screensaver is developed in Python and the source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-screensaver>`_.

cinnamon
~~~~~~~~

The Cinnamon github project is the biggest and most active project within the overall project.

It contains various subcomponents written in C:

======== ==============================================================================================
St       Cinnamon's widget toolkit written on top of Clutter
Appsys   An abstraction of Gio.AppInfo and cinnamon-menus, providing metadata on installed applications
DocInfo  An abstraction of recently opened documents
Tray     A small library for managing status icons
======== ==============================================================================================

The visible layer of the desktop is written in Javascript:

===========  =======================================================================
Cinnamon JS  The panels, window management, HUD, effects and most of what you see...
Applets      The applets within the panel
Desklets     The desklets on top of the desktop
===========  =======================================================================

The System Settings, its configuration modules and utility scripts are written in Python.

Cinnamon is developed in C, Python and Javascript and the source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon>`_.

nemo
~~~~

Nemo is Cinnamon's file manager. When you open up your home directory or when browse files you're running Nemo.

Another little part of Nemo is `nemo-desktop`. Its role is to handle desktop icons and the desktop context menu.

When you log in, `nemo-desktop` is started automatically by cinnamon-session. The `nemo` process itself only starts when you're browsing through the directories and stops wen you close the last opened file manager window.

Nemo is developed in C and the source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo>`_.

nemo-extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nemo provides a set of APIs and is very easy to extend, both in C and in Python. `nemo-extensions` is the Github project where common extensions are stored.

Some Nemo extensions are developed in C and some in Python. Their source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo-extensions>`_.

cinnamon-control-center
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although `cinnamon-settings` (which is part of the Cinnamon project itself) and most of its modules are written in Python. A few configuration modules are still written in C.

.. note::
	Historically, when Cinnamon was forked from GNOME 3, all configuration modules were written in C, as part of gnome-control-center. At the beginning of the Cinnamon project, all configurations modules were thus written in C and were part of cinnamon-control-center. Since then the vast majority of modules were rewritten from scratch in Python and moved to the Cinnamon project itself.

Nowadays, only a few modules are still in cinnamon-control-center:

================ ==================================
color            Color profiles
datetime         Date and Time configuration
display          Display and monitors configuration
network          Network configuration
online-accounts  Online Accounts configuration
wacom            Wacom devices configuration
================ ==================================

Cinnamon-control-center is developed in C and the source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-control-center>`_.
